# Galatic Gunslingers
Galactic Gunslingers is a turn-based roguelike dungeon crawler in space that is currently in the early stages of development. As of now, the game consists of a menu screen, options, and a single level for the player. 

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Must have both Unity installed along with some IDE for writing in C#.

## Installation
To get started on the project, simply clone the repository to your computer. Once that is done, extract the project file out from the zip. Open up Unity, select "Open Project" and select the STR_DCIS project. The project should now be set up and ready for development/testing. 

# Running the Test
Tests are already built into the unity project file so it is very simple to run. There is a Unity Test Runner tool that is available for this very purpose. To open it, navigate to Window > Test Runner and select "Run All". 

# Deployment
Deploying the game is very simple as building the game into an executable file is all that needs to be done. There should be a build option in unity that when used will give this .exe file that can be given to anyone.
